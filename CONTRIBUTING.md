## Code Style

Please follow the coding style used in the project. Here are a few guidelines:

- Use **2 spaces** for indentation (no tabs).
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Keep your code simple, clean, and well-commented.
- Avoid large, monolithic commits. Break your work into logical chunks.

## Testing

Before submitting your pull request, please run tests to ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality.

If you're adding new functionality, ensure that you add appropriate tests for it. For the compiler, we encourage writing tests that check for correctness and performance.
